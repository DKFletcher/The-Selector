# Reflector Selector

I developed this app using cardeo on [RayWenderlich](https://wwww.raywenderlich.com ) as a starting point. It was an obvious choice, I was on the prowl for an iOS app and this leapt out at me as really well thought out and robust. It also dovetailed almost exactly into an  emotions jQuery app that Alan McLean and myself had developed for [whatmotivateslearning](https://www.whatmotivateslearning.com).

It is a school resource for group and individual work and gets kids to learn about  their emotions in a fun way. There is also lots of serious school type work but I  think it's got the balance right.

Over and above the original code a workbook was added; the ability to set your own  images and a document collation model describing Alan's unique and intuitive emotions taxonomy.

Along with the workbook I coded a good strong print engine that was tested using  the first chapter of *Alice in Wonderland*. I input this text into 240 separate  text Areas. A fault free run covering just under 2000 pages.

There is an update scheduled for when the school's return after August. The areas  for development are:
* at the moment each emotion has a stock image and an actor image. A beefed up image server could deliver an open ended image bank.
* an improved worktable tableView cell that removes the need for multi-touch  gestures.
* a dedicated focus question tool set.
