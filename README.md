# Reflector Selector

I developed this app using cardeo on [RayWenderlich.com](https://wwww.raywenderlich.com ) as a starting point. It was an obvious choice as I was on the prowl for an iOS app and this leapt out at me as a realy well thought out and robust. It also dovetailed exactly into the emotions work that Alan McLean and myself had developed for [whatmotivateslearning](https://www.whatmotivateslearning.com).

It is a school resource for group and individual work and gets kids to learn about their emotions in a fun way. There is also lots of serious school type work but I think it's got the balance right.

 Over and above the original code a workbook was added; the ability to set your own images. Along with the workbook I coded a good strong print engine that was tested using the first chapter of *Alice in Wonderland* inputed into 240 seperate textAreas. A fault free run covering just under 2000 pages.

 There is an update scheduled for when the schoool's return after August (covid-19 permitting). The areas for development are:

 * at the moment each emotion cas have a stock image and an actor image. I think this needs to expand to an open ended image bank.

 * an improved worktable tableview cell that removes the need for multi-touch gestures.

 * a dedicated focus question tool set.

Oh, and did I mention it's got the best organising structure for emotions that you are _**ever**_ likely to see. Seriously, you have to see this to believe it.
